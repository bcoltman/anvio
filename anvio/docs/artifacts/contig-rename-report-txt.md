A two-column TAB-delmited file containing the association between an old set of names in a %(fasta)s file, and a new set of names.

In each line, the first column lists the *original name* and the second column lists the *new name* of any given contig.

By default, this file is generated by %(anvi-script-reformat-fasta)s, when it is run with the flags `--simplify-names` and `--report-file`.

Reference databases required for %(anvi-reaction-network)s are stored in **directories of downloaded files set up by %(anvi-setup-modelseed-database)s and %(anvi-setup-kegg-data)s**.

%(anvi-reaction-network)s currently relies upon comparison of KEGG Orthology (KO) gene annotations (%(kegg-functions)s) stored in a %(contigs-db)s to reference databases: KEGG [KO](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ko.html) and [ModelSEED Biochemistry](https://github.com/ModelSEED/ModelSEEDDatabase). The ModelSEED Biochemistry database harmonizes and consolidates reference data from multiple sources, including KEGG, in two comprehensive tables of reactions and compounds.

The KEGG databases (%(kegg-data)s) can be obtained by running %(anvi-setup-kegg-data)s, and the ModelSEED database can be obtained by running %(anvi-setup-modelseed-database)s.
